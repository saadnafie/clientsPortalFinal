## About Clients Portal

The Clients Portal is the portal for Clean Sheet Group clients, helping them submit their candidate certificates and licences for our system to be checked and verified. Those make it easier for them to get updated about their application status and be notified whenever any required files are missing in the submitted applications.

The following are some of the tasks that Clean Sheet Group provides through this portal:

- Submitting the candidate's applications to our system to be verified
- Detailed statistics about the status and progress of the application
- The ability to update or delete the application
- A verification history provides all historical information about the application process
- Two different account types (individual and corporate)
